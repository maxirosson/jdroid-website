        severity="Warning"
        message="Unnecessary; SDK_INT is always >= 19"
        category="Performance"
        priority="6"
        summary="Obsolete SDK_INT Version Check"
        explanation="This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the `minSdkVersion` (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high as the version checked for.&#xA;&#xA;Similarly, it also looks for resources in `-vNN` folders, such as `values-v14` where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the `minSdkVersion`, where the contents should be merged into the best folder."
